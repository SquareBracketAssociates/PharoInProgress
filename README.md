# Pharo In Progress

These chapters are part of [an experiment](https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/PharoForTheEnterprise-english) of writing a book with the Pier syntax using plain-text editors. Once they are ready for review we can move them to Pharo-ReadyForReviews.

This book is continuously built on an [Inria Jenkins server](https://ci.inria.fr/pharo-contribution/job/PharoBookWorkInProgress/).


How to write
------------

This book is written in Pillar markup. If you are not familiar with it please check the [pillar-documentation](https://github.com/pillar-markup/pillar-documentation).
