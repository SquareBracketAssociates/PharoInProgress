! Tiny Chat!! To do before starting to write- start	console := TCConsole attach: self.		self exit: false.		lastMessageIndex := self readLastMessageID.	self refreshMessages.	I would not link the UI to the model	- we should revisit the process logic of the client.[[[readMessages	"Get the new messages that have been posted since the last request."		| response receivedMessages |	response := ZnClient new url: self cmdMessages; get.	^ response 		ifNil: [ 0 ]		ifNotNil: [  			receivedMessages := response subStrings: String crlf.			receivedMessages do: [ :msg | messages add: (TCMessage fromString: msg) ].			receivedMessages size.		].]]]- why do we readMessage returns 0and [[[readLastMessageID	| id |	id := (ZnClient new url: self cmdLastMessageID; get) asInteger.	id = 0 ifTrue: [  id := 1 ].	^ id]]]!!
